# The Utils module (Maybe rename preprocess?)
The utils module contains for now all of the components listed as Spark-NLP transformer https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/transformers
Exceptions are the SparkNLP finisher and EmbeddingsFinisher, since they have no use for external users

Additional 3rd party non-NLU components which are still dependencies belong here.


- chunk_2_doc
